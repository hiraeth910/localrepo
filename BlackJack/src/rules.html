        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p> * After starting the game both user and system get`s two cards.
            * Each card comes from 1-13 of hearts.
            * Face cards are always equal to 10 so u'll never see a face acrd in the game
            * Ace can have two values either '1' if total is greater than 11 else '11' 
            * On first Draw if user gets 21 he/she will be considered as winner irrespective to system 
            * User can either take a new card(by clicking hit) or allow syatem to take a new card(by clicking stand *sometimes u have 2 press 2 times).
            * U shouldn`t let the sum of user cards cross 21 so play carefully
            * If you let the system take the card you won`t  get the chance to take a card again
            * Refresh the Browser to Start a new Game</p>
